    <h2>Description</h2>
    Tripe soup or tripe stew is a soup or stew made with tripe (cow or lamb/mutton stomach). It is widely (not
    universally) considered to be a hangover remedy.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450 grams) tripe</li>
        <li>1.5 Cup Sunflower Oil</li>
        <li>3 Cups fresh milk</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>3 Teaspoon Paprika</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Black Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon spicy pepper (or chilli) powder</li>
        <li>3 Garlic cloves, diced into tiny pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Wine Vinegar (red)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the tripe</li>
        <li>Boil the tripe for 4-5 minutes and clean it from both sites until all marks and fat layers are completely
            gone</li>
        <li>Rinse the tripe and keep it in cold water</li>
        <li>Simmer for 4-5 hours and keep periodically adding water to make sure the trip is submerged</li>
        <li>Take the cooked tripe out and cut it into chunks or mince it, depending on your preference</li>
        <li>Add the tripe back in the same water (this is very important)</li>
        <li>Add some oil, milk, salt, black pepper, spicy pepper powder, and diced garlic</li>
        <li>Leave it on low flame for another 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Before you serve, add some red wine vinegar into the soup</li>
        <li>Serve it with some fresh bread and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
